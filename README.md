# Churn-Prediction-Neural-Network

Churn prediction aims to detect customers intended to leave a service provider. This modelling enables the companies or organisations to identify the areas where they lag behind, thereby enabling them to rectify those issues and also aid in increasing te retention rate. 

## Context 
Business like banks which provide service have to worry about problem of 'Customer Churn' i.e customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.

## Objective 
To build a neural network based classifer that can determine whether a customer will leave the bank or not in the next 6 months.
